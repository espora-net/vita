## Welcome to Vita

This app will allow you to learn about best practices about your career and how to present your experience. A key feature is the capability to export your LinkedIn Profile Information into a Europass compatible format.

### Personal Data

This app does not store any personal information and all transformation is done in your computer through [WebAssembly Technology](https://webassembly.org/)

App will ask permissions for your Profile based on the fields available on the [API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/shared/integrations/people/profile-api)
### Start

You could start after [LinkedIn login](https://www.linkedin.com/)
